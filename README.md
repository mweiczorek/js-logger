# Logger v3

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40nolawnchairs%2Flogger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40nolawnchairs%2Flogger)

Version 3.x is incompatible with 2.x and 1.x. Note that this project is more or less an "in-house" tool, so no guarantees.

For v2 docs, go [here](V2.md)

## Install
```
npm i @nolawnchairs/logger
yarn add @nolawnchairs/logger
```

## Setting Logging Up

As opposed to v2, there is more boilerplate to configure, since we now provide multiple logging environments that can each write to multiple output streams.
